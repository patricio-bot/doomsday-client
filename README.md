## Description

---

<br/>
<p>This application allows users to know their remaining life time, based on age, lifestyle, weight, height, for example. At the same time, it determines the most probable cause of death and its symptoms. The application has two modes of use, one for betting and one for challenge. Depending on the mode chosen by the user, the application will assign tasks to be performed.</p>
<br/>

## User Stories

---

- **Signup**: As anon users we can sign up in the app so we can get our life expectancy.
- **Login**:
  As a user I can log in to the app to see my pending tasks, the tasks performed, create new tasks, change the user mode, visit the judges' wall and edit my profile.
- **Logout**: As a user I can exit the App by closing my session.

- **Dashboard**:
  As a user I can check the updated life expectancy counter, as well as the probable cause of my death and the APP mode.

* **List of Tasks**: As a user I can check my tasks either completed or pending.

* **Add task**: As a user I can create new tasks with different difficulty levels.

* **The Judges' wall**: As a user I can visit the Judges' Wall, where I can see my current score and interact with other users.

* **Necrology**: As a user I can see the users who have died.

* **At Doomsday's Door**: As user I can filter users by illness and see their life expectancy.

* **User profile**: As user I can see, edit or delete my profile.

* **404**:
  As a user I can try to cheat the App and get an error for a response (and that's because Doomsday is benevolent).
